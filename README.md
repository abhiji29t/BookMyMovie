# BookMyMovie

Objective: To check out the now showing movies and their details


Features as per assignment:

1) Page for viewing now showing movies 

2) Page for viewing details of a movie like synopsis, cast, reviews, similar movies.

3) Implemented caching of movies searched. If a cached movie is clicked again, it is bumped up to the top position in cache.

4) Implemented a search algortihm which searches all the words in search string through all words in movie names and looks for search words as prefix in movie name words.

5) Unit tests are written to test the search algorithm for the cases given in assignment.


Additional Feature:

Added a booking page where you can view the bookings made by user. Bookings can made from both now showing and detail page.
And guess what, I am giving tickets for FREE. But don't get too greedy in hoarding multiple tickets of same movie unless you want to get scolded by a "ViewController". Any type of hoarding is bad during a ongoing pandemic.



Didn't get much time to go crazy with UI but I had fun building it and reading horrible movie reviews.
